        <p>Many business owners have already transformed their accounting into a strong foundation for growth.</p>

            <h3>Commonwealth Counseling <br> Associates, PC</h3>
            <h4>Dr J. Bullock</h4>
            <p>"Our rapidly growing healthcare business urgently required a broadly experienced bookkeeper to assist
              with complex payroll issues and related tax and bookkeeping duties. Mrs. Arnold quickly learned our
              business protocols and work flow; as a result, she was able to take over many of the core bookkeeping
              tasks, including the more complex tasks, immediately. This is particularly impressive because the
              consulting relationship we established relies largely on electronic communication, as our firm is located
              about 100 miles south of Mrs. Arnold's offices. I have found Mrs. Arnold to be very bright, very
              knowledgeable, detail-oriented, precise in her work, and proactive in addressing our needs. Moreover, she
              has been prompt and personable in all of our dealings with her."</p>

          <div class="testimonials-card">
            <h3>Managing Director <br> Piedmont Fund Services, Inc</h3>
            <h4>M. Ringler</h4>
            <p>"We contracted with Legible Ledgers after our previous accountants were fired and Marjorie was brought on
              to clean up our accounting books and records. It was in a bad shape but Marjorie was able to get the books
              reconciled in a timely manner. We knew we had someone good when our client invoices went on time without
              any issues. She is great with her knowledge of QuickBooks and made our lives much easier!"</p>

          <div class="testimonials-card">
            <h3>Owner <br> Paint Guys, Inc</h3>
            <h4>B. Parsons</h4>
            <p>"I have worked with Marjorie, of Legible Ledgers Bookkeeping, for about 4 years. She has always been
              professional, timely, and trustworthy. Besides just being capable, she gave us the attention we needed as
              small business owners. I give her my highest recommendation."</p>

          <div class="testimonials-card">
            <h3>Washington DC Alumnae Foundation Inc</h3>
            <h4>A. Doman</h4>
            <p>"Ms. Marjorie Arnold provided exemplary service to my organization. She entered and reconciled 19 months
              of raw data into QB to get our organization up and running in record time after months of not using QB.
              She was able to grasp our former Treasurer's system and make recommendation and changes to improve our QB
              usage. This included, Ms. Arnold developing reports to make it easier for us to query and generate data.
              She is very personable, approachable and makes you feel comfortable when asking questions. I am extremely
              appreciative of the services she provided and just wish my organization had met her sooner. Thank you
              Marjorie for everything!"</p>
